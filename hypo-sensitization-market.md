<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypo-sensitization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Subcutaneous Immunotherapy</li><li>Sublingual Immunotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hypo-sensitization market consists of two primary types: subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). SCIT involves administering allergen extracts via injection, gradually increasing the dose to build tolerance, typically performed in clinical settings. In contrast, SLIT entails placing allergen extracts under the tongue for absorption, offering a more convenient, self-administered alternative. Both methods aim to alleviate allergy symptoms by re-educating the immune system, but they differ in delivery methods, administration settings, and patient convenience.</p></p>
