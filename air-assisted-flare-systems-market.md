<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Assisted Flare Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Smokeless</li><li>Low Smoke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air Assisted Flare Systems are designed to improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions during industrial gas flaring. The market is categorized into two main types: smokeless and low smoke flares. Smokeless flares facilitate complete combustion, resulting in negligible visible emissions, making them suitable for environmentally-sensitive operations. Low smoke flares, while slightly less efficient, produce minimal visible smoke and are preferred in applications where emissions management is critical but not as stringent as for smokeless options. Both types enhance environmental compliance and operational efficiency.</p></p>
