<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioimpedance Spectroscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-frequency Bioimpedance spectroscopy</li><li>Multiple-frequency Bioimpedance spectroscopy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioimpedance spectroscopy market is divided into two main types: single-frequency and multiple-frequency bioimpedance spectroscopy. Single-frequency bioimpedance spectroscopy measures resistance at one frequency, making it simpler and cost-effective, often used for basic body composition analysis. In contrast, multiple-frequency bioimpedance spectroscopy utilizes various frequencies to provide a more detailed analysis of tissue composition and fluid distribution, enhancing diagnostic accuracy for conditions like edema and heart failure. This differentiation allows healthcare providers to choose the appropriate technology based on their diagnostic needs.</p></p>
