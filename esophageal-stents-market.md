<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Esophageal Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-expandable Metallic Stents (SEMS)</li><li>Self-expanding Plastic Stents (SEPS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The esophageal stents market comprises primarily two types: Self-expandable Metallic Stents (SEMS) and Self-expanding Plastic Stents (SEPS). SEMS are designed for long-term use, offering durability and effective management of esophageal obstruction, particularly in cancer patients. They are made from materials like stainless steel or nitinol. Conversely, SEPS are utilized for shorter-term applications, providing a more flexible option but with less durability than SEMS. Both types are crucial in improving patient quality of life by alleviating swallowing difficulties.</p></p>
