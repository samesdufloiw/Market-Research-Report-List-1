<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Home Lightings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid Solar</li><li>Grid-tied Solar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Solar Home Lightings market consists of two main types: off-grid solar and grid-tied solar systems. Off-grid solar systems operate independently from the utility grid, utilizing batteries to store energy for use during the night or cloudy days, making them ideal for remote areas. In contrast, grid-tied solar systems are connected to the utility grid, allowing users to leverage grid electricity when needed and potentially sell excess energy back, promoting energy efficiency and sustainability in urban settings.</p></p>
