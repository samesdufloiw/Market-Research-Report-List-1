<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Delivery Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-loop</li><li>Close-loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The insulin delivery pump market is categorized into open-loop and closed-loop systems. Open-loop pumps allow users to manually adjust insulin delivery based on their blood glucose levels, providing flexibility but requiring constant monitoring. In contrast, closed-loop systems, often referred to as artificial pancreas systems, automatically adjust insulin delivery based on real-time glucose readings, minimizing user intervention. Both systems aim to enhance diabetes management, with closed-loop pumps offering a more automated approach, improving convenience and glycemic control.</p></p>
